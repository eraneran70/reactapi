# Panel

> A `Panel` is a collapsible control for presenting information in a limited amount of space.
By default, all it does is apply some basic border and padding to contain some content.

You can easily add a heading container to your panel with the `header` property.

You can pass buttons or secondary text in the `footer` property. Note that
panel footers do not inherit colors and borders when using contextual
variations as they are not meant to be in the foreground.
